good
increase stability of robot
learn what we wanted from the intake
learned need freedom to shoot wherever
5 ball auto
driver profiles done
tested scouting app and it works
verified with feeder station
no bugs: self driving or death spin

bad
need battery beak
build a wall
lots of downtime
make a list of things to bring
better preparation
split things up (some at shop)
why does LL turn off sometimes?
taking learning from this - what broke
intake target for defense against us
get a better camera mount for seeing balls inside robot - communication with manip/driver/coach
running over balls
need more driver practice

Things to add
Gopro to see robot driving

Complaints
Ethan's sensitivity on joysticks
manip override to turn on shooter when they see have 5 balls
intake retract option for manip/automatically when shooter starts
auto targeting for feeder station
have a camera connected
investigate ways to make feeder station alignment easier- flag/tilt camera/etc
lower drift on rotation - ethan's settings
add same rotation lock on high speeds as low speeds
5 ball auto on far side 
need auto- shoot 3, clear init line, get out of way
need to shoot from trench (next shooter design and tuning)
